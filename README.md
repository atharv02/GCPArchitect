# Creating a cheatsheet for the GCP Architect exam

I recently passed my GCP Architect exam. I found a certain lack of material for simply revising the important features of the various products that I could refer to, the night before my exam, without having to dig through various Blog posts/ articles. 

This is my attempt to cover off a summarised version of most of the topics and my personal notes to revise before the exam.

Please feel free to send me a PR.

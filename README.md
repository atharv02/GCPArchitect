# Creating a cheatsheet for the GCP Architect exam

I recently passed my GCP Architect exam. I found a certain lack of material for simply revising the important features of the various products that I could refer to, the night before my exam, without having to dig through various Blog posts/ articles. 

This is my attempt to cover off a summarised version of most of the topics and my personal notes to revise before the exam.

My Experience with the Exam:
 - 2 hours with 50 questions
 - First 10-15 questions were based on the case studies (2 out of the 4)
 - Case studies are available to reference during the exam
 - Sufficient time, though I would recommend *flag for review* where unsure and revisit those questions at the end.
 - Generally 2 options can be eliminated easily, comes down to picking the best of the remaining 2 options
 - Only shows Pass/Fail at the end of the exam. You cannot tell how well you did. 
 - Cloud IoT Core service has been deprecated and is not part of the exam anymore

Lastly, if you are appearing for the exam, wish you the best of luck
